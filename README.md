# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is a project I worked on for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

To play, just open `index.html` in the browser of your choice and open the browser's console. You will be asked to enter "rock," "paper," or "scissors" five times to play an automated game of rock-paper-scissors against your computer. The winner will be declared at the end!

This game is entirely console-based and does not *yet* have a user interface. Thanks for exploring my projects!
